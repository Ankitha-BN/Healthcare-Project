# Healthcare Analytics-Project (Interactive Dashboard creation using MS Excel/Power BI/Tableau)
This Healthcare Analytics project focuses on analyzing hospital and patient-related data to generate meaningful insights that support better clinical and operational decision-making. The project covers the complete data analytics lifecycle, from data collection and preparation to KPI analysis and interactive dashboard creation using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau.

**Project Objectives** 
- Analyze healthcare data related to patients, doctors, visits, treatments, diagnoses, and lab results.
- Evaluate treatment effectiveness and patient trends.
- Identify high-risk patients for proactive care.
- Build interactive dashboards highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Provide insights to improve patient care quality, resource allocation, and hospital efficiency.

- Project Process
- 1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preparation **
- Collected data from patients, doctors, visits, treatments, diagnoses, and lab results
- Cleaned and standardized data fields such as dates, diagnosis names, treatment categories, and demographics
- Loaded the cleaned data into **SQL/MySQL** for preprocessing and structured querying.
- 2️⃣ Data Modeling
- Designed a **Star Schema** for efficient analytical reporting
- **Fact Tables**: Visits, Treatments
- **Dimension Tables**: Patients, Doctors, Diagnoses
- 3️⃣ KPI & Dashboard Development
- Defined KPIs related to treatment success rate, average treatment cost, doctor performance, and patient distribution
- Built interactive dashboards with filters, drilldowns, and cross-analysis
- 
- 📈 Analysis
- **Excel**: Used pivot tables and charts for initial data exploration and KPI tracking
